# DeltaVision Screenshots Guide

This directory contains placeholder image files for the DeltaVision website. To generate actual screenshots of the application, follow these steps:

## Required Screenshots

2. **diff-view.png** - Side-by-side file comparison view with highlighted differences
3. **search-view.png** - Search results view with highlighted matches

## How to Generate Screenshots

1. Open the `generate-screenshots.html` file in a web browser (located in the parent directory)
2. Use browser developer tools or a screen capture tool to take screenshots of each mockup
3. Save the screenshots with the filenames listed above
4. Replace the placeholder files in this directory with your actual screenshots

## Image Specifications

- Recommended dimensions: 800x600 pixels
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- File size: Keep under 300KB per image for optimal website performance

Once you've replaced these placeholder images with actual screenshots, the website will automatically display them.
